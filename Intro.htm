The game has been an idea given and compiled by Divyansh Shekhar, CEO of Magic Car.\n\nHOW TO PLAY\n\nAs you read earlier, the game has 15 questions. You can press \"DEMO\" to practise/practice with easy questions. However, when you press \"PLAY\" to play the real game, they are not the questions as easy as in the demo. The game will ask you the first question, of course. It will ask (not in the demo), \"Write an eight-letter word starting with a vowel\". It will give you an on-screen keyboard on which you have to type the answer. Typing a wrong answer will take one life away from you. After losing all your 4 lifes, you will get a black screen with \"Game Over!\" written on it. Below it, \"Try Again or Give up?\" is written. After that you know what to do.\n\nCOUNTDOWNS (BOMBS)\n\nBe aware of numbers counting down to your doom. The \"BOMBS\" are boxes with numbers written on them. But these numbers aren't harmless at all. They come in a few questions and count from 10 (sometimes 6 or 4!) to 0. When the bomb reaches 0, you instantly lose all your 4 lives, thus, ending up in a game over. So, you only have a few seconds on these bomb questions to get correct answers and proceed to the next question.\n\nSKIPS\n\n\"Skips\" are green coloured arrow shaped symbols with two ?\'s on them. You can get these by answering a certain number of questions. There are 3 of these throughout the game. Skips let you skip a question if you just do not know the answer.\n\nInspired by \"The Impossible Quiz\".";
